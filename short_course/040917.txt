#session 10:00 - 11:00

# what do infecious disease have in common
+ transmission
-diffenet forms
+ basic reproduction number - R_0
- how many other prople one person infects
- needs to be >0 for an epidemic to take off
- reavent to the begining of an epidemic
- T_g feneration time and R_0 determin growth rate (rate of what - seems the exponential growth stage of the epidemic up tp equilibruim)


+ critical vaccine coverage
reduce the reporduction number by reducing the number of people that are susceptible.
- critical coverage 
p_c = (R_0 -1) / R_0
- when R_0 is large, we need to maintain high coverage, like measles

# contrilling indecious disease
+control R_0 so that R_0 <1
+doable through 
-reducing contacts (quarantine, social distancing
-reducing susceptibility (vaccination, prophylaxis
-reduce infectiousness (eg: treatment

+ targets who, how much effort, how to estiamte R_0 and T_0


# More about R_0
+ not a fundamental biological constant

+ determined by pathogen biology (pathogenesis, lifecucle, variability), host factors(genetics, nutrition, age, co-mobidities), population structure (demography, contact patterns)

# a demonstraction of R_0 (simplified, not recommended, because you can never be accurate)
+ R+0 = D * c * p
- where D: mean lengthion and epidemic modelling
 of tieme infectious
- c: rate at which contacts occir
- probability of transmission per contact




# model validation
training dataset and validation dataset - as comparable as possible, but hard to have such datasets

models should reproduce paste epidemics (goodness of fit)


# what are models for 
+ qualirarive
+ predictive
+ operational




# natual history, evolution, interventions, demofraphy, epidemilology, contact patterns and assumptions 
# model
# insight into mechanism, fundamental parameters, detailed predictions etc


# Trends in modelling
traditional - equilibrium
then dynamics of epidemics
real-time modelling due to eg SARS
seasonal and spatioal fynamics
model fitting / parameter estimation
targetting interventions
integrating generics, evolut
