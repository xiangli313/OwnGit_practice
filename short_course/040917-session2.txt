# Introduction to designing infectious disease models (1)

# model - sumplification of a system, suitable for analysis and thinking

+ we are interested in the population-level effect of processes occurring at the individual level

+ force of infection : an uninfected indicidual's rish of becoming infected depends upon the prevalence of infectious individuals, rate of contact, infectiousness of infected individuals, etc. 

~ transimission is a dynamic process


+natual history of infection --> latency, infectious period, immunity
+ transmission of infection
+population structure and demograpjy
+interventions


# the simplist compartmental model - compartments and rates of change(birth rate, incidence of infection, recovery rate, mortality rate, added risk etc)

state of system (state variable) --> changes of the state of the system (differential equations)--> state of the system (state variable updated)


??? incubation and latent  periods

 per-capita rate (hazard)

force of infection - per-capita rate of infection of susceptibles
+ it depends on the number of infectious, contact rate, transmission probeability (p of infection per contact)
+ therefore it is non-linear
