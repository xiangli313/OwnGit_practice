# Model - four typrs
+ qualitative
+ predictive
+ inferenctial
+ operational


### Kermac and McKendrick models - some of their models track through time? seems yes

# Frost and Agent based simulation - first example of MCMC simulation

# reed-frost model - probabilistic model of epidemic spread

# event-driven stochastic sir model
 --- time to the next event is drawn from Poisson distribution
# stochastic compartmental models

# heterogenerous contact - metapopulation, spatial(distancece), group, netwoek  		

# three differnt ways of modelling
frequentist: likelihood ratio test
information thero: AIC/BIC
Bayesian 
+ likelihood penalises goodness-of-fit
