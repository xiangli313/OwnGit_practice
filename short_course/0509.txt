## First session is about R_0 the basic reproduction rate.
# probability of contact and transmission

+ what is a contact ? Interesting

+ probability of trnasmission - is per contact

+ it is interesting to understand R_0 = p c D, and there inter-relations
- probability of transmission, contact rate, duration of infeciousness

+ it is interesting to know the above, but it is prefeablt to esimtate R_o indirectly. Because direct estimation is too


== I am not sure if I understand right. R_0 is the called basic reproduction rate, it assumes that when a person is infected and introduced into a population that is fully susceptiable, how may he can infect is R_0. It is variable, because as time goes on, fewer susceptiable people (periodic, because each year, we have new borns), treatment, etc.




## Session 2 : Tini's herd effect


+ cohort study --> relative risk
+ case-control cohort --> odds ratio

+ incidence and prevelence are related, so we have differential equations. eg dI/dt = f(I/N), where dI/dt is incidence and I?N is prevelence

+ indirect effects of interventions - can have 

+risk factors for susceptibility to infection can be studied in cohot studies (if case-control studies, needs to be caucious)

# popularion level study
+ ecolofical analysis
+ mathematical modelling
+ cluster randomized trails - the gold standard


# herd immunity and critical vaccine coverage
+ if I understand right, herd effect happens when teh critical vaccine coverage is met
+ therefore it is again a story of R_0
+ OK, R_0 is cool
+ p_c = (R_0 - 1) / R_0



# attributing disease to risk factors
+ populataion : it is not homogeneous with respect to risk of acquiring disease
- (PAF) population attribution fraction -> measure impact of a risk facrot on disease incidence in a population
- you need to check the definition of PAF

+ case-cotrol study --> RR
+ epidemic modelling --> p_D
