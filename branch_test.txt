This file is created to record some git practices.

Now, I am going to save this file and push it to master branch.

Then I am going to switch into branch test, and see how far I am behind the master branch.

test branch was 2 commits behind the master.

Instead of directly trying to 'off the master branch', I created an empty file, and see whether it affacts the master.

created 'empty.txt', I was 2 commits behind master, and 1 commit ahead of master.

I did git merge master test
I catched up with master, and am 2 commits ahead of master.

Then I came back to the master, and edited this file.

Afterward, I am going to make changes here, and go to test branch, and try another thing called git rebase.
