how do empowered mothers cope with traditions (such as son-preference), mothers are building more self awareness, but son-prefernce is still there.
-> education change attitudes and expectations in individual level
-> but hegemonic traditions still in place
-> self against social and cultural structures

polyphasia - repredentations of woman/mother

whether individualisation comes from urbanlisation or maybe capitalism or education policy? The later two make more sense.


limitation of ranking - could be that all are important, better to ask them to rate identities. So avoid saying ranking some identity low.

don't make statements that you cannot test, e.g. birth order effects, don't say when material resources are limited , XXX because you don't have data to support that. Just say older children have more opportunities of education in families. 

interesting has_brothers -> this may indicates that your power could be low, but the power of your family could be high -> individual power vs group power. -> social identitiy perspective

# double check rank_self and education relation

# explore a bit if motherhood type can predict other variables


## put into limitation section when needed, such as women's own income
## rank identities is another limitation of your survey, use it, but don't say which is high, which is low. because all can be important
